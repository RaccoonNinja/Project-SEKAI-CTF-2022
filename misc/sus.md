## Skills required: Googling

This is a very simple challenge, even for someone like me who has never played [Project SEKAI](https://projectsekai.fandom.com/wiki/Project_SEKAI_Wiki).

## Solution:

Searching with the correct keywords is important here: `sekai purple "sus"` gives [this link](https://sekai-sus-2img.vercel.app/). It gives the flag directly rendered as the 譜面 (gameplay sheet score? - I dunno how it's translated) of a custom Project SEKAI level.
