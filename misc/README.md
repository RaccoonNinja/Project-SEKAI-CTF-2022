# Misc

## Solved challenges:

- Sus
- Console Port

## Reflections:

There's little learning to my solved challenges, but the other challenges are very interesting:
- Vocaloid Heardle: scraping and some ffmpeg magic, to much chore -> skip
- Random Song: blockchain, instaskip
- Matryoshka: from PILlow to Apple iDOT pngs and smart health record and audio denoising
  - the second part is cool but REALLY unfair, given there are no decoders or even sample scripts for players who don't have the correct version of iProducts. *android solo players are getting punished for not being the cool kid*
