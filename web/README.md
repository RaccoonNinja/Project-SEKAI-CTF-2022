## Reflections:

From the number of participants as seen in CTFTimes I wrongly thought it's a beginner-friendly CTF. This is definitely harder than Cyber Apocalypse and DownUnderCTF. Most of the challenges have 2 parts that require different tricks. I'm not very good at blind challenges, especially on approaching such problems systematically. There's definitely no "1 vuln in outdated package and \*\*boom RCE\*\*". Initially they appeared guessy to me but there are good procedural methods to solve them if you dig deep enough.
