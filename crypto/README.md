# Crypto

## Solved challenges:

- Time Capsule
- FaILProof

## Reflections:

The problems are interesting and have no artificial difficulty. I aced time capsule quite quickly but needed some time on FaILProof. I also got some ideas about Secure Imge Encryption when the CTF end was approaching - I didn't make it.
