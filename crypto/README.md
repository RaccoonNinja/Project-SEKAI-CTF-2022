# Crypto

## Solved challenges:

- Time Capsule
- FaILProof

## Reflections:

The problems are interesting and have no artificial difficulty. I aced time capsule quite quickly but needed some time on FaILProof. For Secure Image Encryption I had the idea of using 2 gradient channels right away but I used them in the same pic. Not realizing that I overlooked the `L` (single channel) setting in PIL, I was confused to *what* were being permuted (was it the pixels or the channel values)? I only knew when the CTF end was approaching - I didn't make it.
